## Etymology
The terms laptop and notebook both trace their origins to the early 1980s, coined to describe portable computers in a size class smaller than the contemporary mainstream units (so-called "luggables") but larger than pocket computers.[34][35] The etymologist William Safire traced the origin of laptop to some time before 1984;[36] the earliest attestation of laptop found by the Oxford English Dictionary dates to 1983.[37] The word is modeled after the term desktop, as in desktop computer.[36] Notebook, meanwhile, emerged earlier in 1982[38] to describe Epson's HX-20 portable, whose dimensions roughly correspond to a letter-sized pad of paper.[35][39]: 9 [40] Notebooks emerged as their own separate market from laptops with the release of the NEC UltraLite in 1988.[41]: 16  Notebooks and laptops continued to occupy distinct market segments into the mid-1990s,[42] but ergonomic considerations and customer preference for larger screens soon led to notebooks converging with laptops in the late 1990s.[43] Today, the terms laptop and notebook are synonymous, with laptop being the more common term in most English-speaking territories.[43][5]

Panasonic Toughbook CF-M34, a rugged laptop/subnotebook
Since the 1970s introduction of portable computers, their forms have changed significantly, spawning a variety of visually and technologically differing subclasses. Excepting distinct legal trademark around terms (notably Ultrabook), hard distinctions between these classes were rare, and their usage has varied over time and between sources. Since the late 2010s, more specific terms have become less commonly used, with sizes distinguished largely by the size of the screen.
1. Smaller and larger laptops

* Main articles: Notebook (laptop), Subnotebook, and Desktop replacement computer
There were in the past a number of marketing categories for smaller and larger laptop computers; these included "notebook" and "subnotebook" models, low cost "netbooks", and "ultra-mobile PCs" where the size class overlapped with devices like smartphone and handheld tablets, and "Desktop replacement" laptops for machines notably larger and heavier than typical to operate more powerful processors or graphics hardware. All of these terms have fallen out of favor as the size of mainstream laptops has gone down and their capabilities have gone up; except for niche models, laptop sizes tend to be distinguished by the size of the screen, and for more powerful models, by any specialized purpose the machine is intended for, such as a "gaming laptop" or a "mobile workstation" for professional use.

Convertible, hybrid, 2-in-1

2.  Main article: 2-in-1 PC
   * The latest trend of technological convergence in the portable computer industry spawned a broad range of devices, which combined features of several previously separate device types. The hybrids, convertibles, and 2-in-1s emerged as crossover devices, which share traits of both tablets and laptops. All such devices have a touchscreen display designed to allow users to work in a tablet mode, using either multi-touch gestures or a stylus/digital pen.

  * Convertibles are devices with the ability to conceal a hardware keyboard. Keyboards on such devices can be flipped, rotated, or slid behind the back of the chassis, thus transforming from a laptop into a tablet. Hybrids have a keyboard detachment mechanism, and due to this feature, all critical components are situated in the part with the display. 2-in-1s can have a hybrid or a convertible form, often dubbed 2-in-1 detachable and 2-in-1 convertibles respectively, but are distinguished by the ability to run a desktop OS, such as Windows 10. 2-in-1s are often marketed as laptop replacement tablets.[45]

  * 2-in-1s are often very thin, around 10 millimetres (0.39 in), and light devices with a long battery life. 2-in-1s are distinguished from mainstream tablets as they feature an x86-architecture CPU (typically a low- or ultra-low-voltage model), such as the Intel Core i5, run a full-featured desktop OS like Windows 10, and have a number of typical laptop I/O ports, such as USB 3 and Mini DisplayPort.
